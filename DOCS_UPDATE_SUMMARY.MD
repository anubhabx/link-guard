## ✅ Accuracy Improvements

### Fixed Incorrect Information
1. ✅ v0.2.0 status: "In Progress" → "Completed"
2. ✅ Configuration support: "Coming Soon" → "Implemented"
3. ✅ .linkguardignore: "v0.3.0 planned" → "Implemented"
4. ✅ CLI options: Missing concurrency/ignore/verbose → All documented
5. ✅ Test status: Unclear → "Configured but not written"

### Added Missing Information
1. ✅ formatter.py is empty (Rich code in cli.py)
2. ✅ logger.py needs implementation
3. ✅ Exit code 3 not yet implemented
4. ✅ Known limitations (bot detection, no retry logic)
5. ✅ Specific line counts for each module

### Clarified Ambiguous Items
1. ✅ "Configuration file support" → Fully implemented with precedence
2. ✅ "Testing infrastructure" → Configured in pyproject.toml, no tests written
3. ✅ "Rich output" → Implemented in cli.py, not formatter.py
4. ✅ "URL extraction" → Supports 8 file types, 3 patterns

## 🔍 Key Insights from Code Review

### What's Actually Complete ✅
- Core scanning pipeline (FileScanner → URLExtractor → LinkChecker → Rules)
- Async link validation with aiohttp (semaphore concurrency)
- URL extraction from 8 file types (Markdown, HTML, JSON, JS/TS)
- Environment rules (localhost, private IPs, dev domains)
- Configuration system (JSON + .linkguardignore with precedence)
- All CLI options (mode, export, timeout, concurrency, ignore, verbose)
- Export formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown with metadata)
- Rich console output (progress bars, colors, tables)

### What's Missing ⬜
- Unit tests (test files exist but are empty)
- Integration tests
- Logger implementation (utils/logger.py is empty)
- Formatter module (formatter.py is empty, code in cli.py)
- Exit code 3 for dev URLs in prod mode
- GitHub Actions CI workflow
- Pre-commit hooks

### What's Partially Done 🔄
- Exit codes (0, 1, 2 implemented; 3 pending)
- Verbose mode (flag exists but logger not implemented)
- Test infrastructure (configured but no tests)

## 🚀 Next Steps for Development

Based on documentation review, the next priorities are:

1. **Implement `utils/logger.py`** (1-2 hours)
   - Add Rich logging
   - Hook up to --verbose flag
   - Add DEBUG/INFO/ERROR levels

2. **Write Unit Tests** (4-6 hours)
   - `tests/test_scanner.py` - File discovery
   - `tests/test_extractor.py` - URL extraction
   - `tests/test_checker.py` - Async link checking
   - `tests/test_config.py` - Configuration loading

3. **Create CI Workflow** (1 hour)
   - `.github/workflows/test.yml`
   - Run tests on push/PR
   - Coverage reporting

4. **Fix Exit Code 3** (15 minutes)
   - Update cli.py to exit with code 3 for dev URLs in prod

5. **Add Screenshots to README** (1 hour)
